## Hi There! 👋
I'm Artemy!

I'm a software engineer with a certificate in back-end engineering from Turing School of Software and Design.

### ⭐️ My favorite part of the tech industry:
How much there is to learn! With technology constantly evolving, there will never be a shortage of learning opportunities.

### ⭐️ My favorite part of projects is:
🐞 Debugging! 🐛 I love digging around, breaking things, writing tests, figuring out how everything works, and solving problems!

### 🪄🎩 Skills/Experience:
##### Most Comfortable
Ruby on Rails || SQL || PostgreSQL || RSpec
##### Exposure
Java || JUnit || GraphQL || HTML || CSS
  
### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
Java! I'm following some tutorials to get some basics, and translating an old school project from Ruby to Java.

My goal is to eventually translate the entire school curriculum I went through from Ruby on Rails to Java and Springboot. Not only will that boost my understanding of Java, but I believe it would also be a great resource for anyone else who is interested in learning it as well.

### 🤔 I’m looking for:
Mentorship. Are you an expert in Java? I'd love some feedback on my projects!
I'm also on the market for an internship, apprenticeship, or junior engineering role. While I may be focusing on Ruby on Rails and Java right now, I'm excited to learn other languages and technologies! If you know a team looking for someone eager to learn (and who always has random fun facts to share) I'd love to connect!
  
### 💬 Ask me about:
Plants! My background is in landscape design and plant bioscience. I'm particularly interested in sustainability.
If your company does any work related to sustainability and the environment, I'd love the connect!
