## Hi There! 👋
I'm Artemy!

I'm a software engineer with a certificate in back-end engineering from Turing School of Software and Design.

### ⭐️ My favorite part of the tech industry:
How much there is to learn! With technology constantly evolving, there will never be a shortage of learning opportunities.

### ⭐️ My favorite part of projects is:
🐞 Debugging! 🐛 I love digging around, breaking things, writing tests, figuring out how everything works, and solving problems!

### 🪄🎩 Skills/Experience:

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
 - Java
   - I'm following some online tutorials and translating an old Ruby project of mine into Java. My long-term goal is to translate the back-end curriculum from Turing School of Software and Design (a Ruby on Rails program) into Java using Springboot. I hope it will be a great resource for others who want to learn Java/Springboot!
 - TypeScript & React
    - I'm building [Memory Match](https://github.com/MemoryMatch) with two front-end developers. I'm the only one on the team that has not worked with TS or React before, and I'm loving the challenge!

### 🤔 I’m looking for:
Mentorship, especially for career guidance. I'd love to meet with folks from various different roles in the tech industry, and learn about what path(s) might be best for me.

I'm also on the market for an internship, apprenticeship, or junior role. If you know a team looking for someone eager to learn (and who always has random fun facts to share) I'd love to connect!
  
### 💬 Ask me about:
Plants! My background is in landscape design and plant bioscience. I'm particularly interested in sustainability.
If your company does any work related to sustainability and the environment, let's talk!
